        <p class="text">Cuba has a tropical climate with warm temperatures year-round and two main seasons. The dry season (November to April) is cooler and less humid, while the wet season (May to October) brings heat, high humidity, and frequent rain. Average temperatures range from 27°C to 32°C, with annual rainfall between 1,000 and 1,500 mm. Hurricane risk peaks from August to October. Western Cuba tends to be cooler and wetter, while eastern areas like Guantánamo are warmer and drier.</p>
