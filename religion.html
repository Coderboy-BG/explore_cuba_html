        <p class="text">Cuban religion is a vibrant mix of Roman Catholicism, Afro-Cuban traditions like Santería, and a growing secular population. While Catholicism remains the most widespread faith, many Cubans practice Santería, a spiritual system blending Yoruba deities (orishas) with Catholic saints. Other Christian denominations, such as Protestants, are present but smaller. A significant portion of the population identifies as non-religious, reflecting Cuba’s secular history. Religious life in Cuba is deeply tied to culture, with rituals, festivals, and beliefs often blending sacred and everyday traditions.</p>
