       <p class="text">Cuba, the largest Caribbean island, spans 110,860 km² and stretches 1,250 km east to west. It’s an archipelago with the main island, the Isle of Youth, and 4,000+ cays. The terrain blends mountains—like the Sierra Maestra with Pico Turquino (1,974 m)—and fertile plains ideal for agriculture. Its 5,700 km coastline features bays, beaches, and ports like Havana and Guantánamo. With a tropical climate and rich biodiversity across mangroves, reefs, and forests, Cuba’s 350,751 km² Exclusive Economic Zone enhances its strategic maritime role.</p>
